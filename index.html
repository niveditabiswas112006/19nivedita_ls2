        <p>[Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali polymath known for his poetry, music, and art. He was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913, mainly for his collection of poetry "Gitanjali" (Song Offerings). Tagore was a prominent figure in the Bengal Renaissance, a period of intellectual and cultural revival in Bengal. He was also a social reformer and a composer, and his works significantly influenced Indian art and culture.]</p>
